# Tests Creator Role

Focus on writing/evaluate functional tests for the required task.

When creating tests you should be making sure that you're not it does not test implementation while rather focus on functionality and behavior of the test.

Rules:
- Check current existing tests
- Tests should be self contained
- Be mindful about setup/teardown
- Do not broaden scope beyond the prompt.
